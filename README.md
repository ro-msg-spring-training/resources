## Working Mode

The road-map consists of several steps. In each step, a set of theoretical concepts are explored, supported by reference documentation, book chapters, tutorials and videos. In parallel, a simple application will be built with the learned concepts: the *Online Shop* application.

After the learning material for a given step was sufficiently explored, either some new functionality will be added to this application or old functionality will be refactored.

The application will have little-to-no user interface. Developers are expected to perform developer tests with Postman once the REST APIs are implemented.

All the code written must be published on GitHub. Commits must be pushed when each individual chapter is finished. In order to request a code review from the trainers, you must [open a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) from the `develop` to the `master` branch.

For doing static code quality checks, two separate mechanisms will be used:
 - The plugin for SonarLint and the built-in code analysis must be used to fix code issues.
 - [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/) will be enabled and developers should check the detected issues periodically. 

## Environment

You can work using your local environment:
 - You need to install [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/apps), [IntelliJ IDEA (Community)](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows), SonarLint and Lombok [plugins for IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html#install_plugin_from_repo). Note: the newer versions of Intellij already have the Lombok installed. Please check it before trying to install it.
 - If Maven does not work because of SSL errors, [setup the Zscaler certificate in your trust store](https://team.msg.de/site/IT/Freigegebene%20Dokumente/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=%2Fsite%2FIT%2FFreigegebene%20Dokumente%2FAnleitungen%2FZscaler&FolderCTID=0x012000581B900D5D91664C93095DB345EDAFC4&View=%7B8F4AC536%2DBC7A%2D4D89%2DA598%2D491A539B7BBE%7D).

In the booking description, please use the following format: `Chapter: Brief activity description`, for the regular calls, simply state the name of the meeting. 

Examples: `1: Reading about dependency injection, spring basics`, `2: Setting up the project.`.

## Online Shop
The application will deal with the management and daily functioning of a small online shop. Business processes:
 - **Order creation**: an end customer places an order to buy several products (based on the availability of the products in the stock).
 - **Stock management**: the existing product stocks are updated automatically based on the orders placed by customers.
 - **Shop analytics**: the management must be able to view the evolution of the daily revenue for each individual location of the shop.

Throughout the application, we assume that prices are always in EUR and weights are always in KG.

 >
 > Translate this data model into Java entity classes. Use Lombok to annotate these classes with `@Data` annotations to generate getters, setters, equals and hashCode. Hint: *it might be useful to create a base entity class (containing just the primary key) or an interface (containing the primary key getter and setter) to be able to handle entities generically later on.*
 > 
 > Annotate all the entities with the proper JPA annotations (`@Entity`, `@OneToMany`, etc). Write Spring Data JPA repositories to allow easy access to your entities.

Online Shop:
 > Create a simple API for exposing the products and product categories: 
 >
 > - Define a DTO (data transfer object) POJO which combines the properties from a product and its respective category. 
 > - Create a service class which uses the repositories in order to: create, update, delete, read by ID and read all the product (as DTO instances).
 > - Build a REST Controller which uses this service.
 >
 > Create a service class that handles the creation of orders. The following constraints apply:
 >
 > - You get a single java object as input. This object will contain the order timestamp, the delivery address and a list of products (product ID and quantity) contained in the order.
 > - You return an Order entity if the operation was successful. If not, you throw an exception.
 > - The service has to select a strategy for finding from which locations should the products be taken. The strategy should be selected based on a `@Configuration`. The following initial strategies should be created: 
 >   - **Single location** - find a single location that has all the required products (with the required quantities) in stock. If there are more such locations, simply take the first one based on the ID.
 >   - **Most abundant** - take each product from the location which has the largest stock for that particular product.
 > - The service then runs the strategy, obtaining a list of objects with the following structure: location, product, quantity (= how many items of the given product are taken from the given location). If the strategy is unable to find a suitable set of locations, it should throw an exception.
 > - The stocks are be updated by subtracting the shipped goods. 
 > - Afterwards the order is persisted in the database and returned.
 > 
 > Create a Rest Controller for the "Create order" operation, which should have a `POST` mapping accepting a JSON request body and producing a JSON response body.

 >
 > - `fromCsv`:
 >   - Has a generic type parameter `<T>`, representing the type of the POJOs stored in the CSV,
 >   - Returns a `List<T>`,
 >   - Has a parameter `Class<T>`,
 >   - Has an input stream parameter containing the CSV file.
 > - `toCsv`:
 >   - Has a generic type parameter `<T>`, representing type of the POJOs stored in the CSV,
 >   - Returns `void`,
 >   - Has a parameter `Class<T>`,
 >   - Has a parameter `List<T>`, representing the list of POJOs to be written in the CSV,

 > Create a `@RestController` enabled just in the `test` profile, which exposes an API for clearing / populating the in-memory database.
 >
 > Implement Postman API tests which use the above-mentioned endpoint to set-up / tear-down the tests, for the following functionalities:
 >
 > - Create a new order successfully,
 > - Export the stocks,
 > - Fail to create a new order due to missing stock,
 > - Fail to create a new order due to unknown product ID(s).
